# Scoop Bucket

This is my personal [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) bucket.  
Currently, it contains the [Helium Browser](https://helium.computer/).  

I've submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/pull/16177) to include Helium in the official [scoop-extras](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras) bucket.  
Until it becomes available there, I’ll maintain and update Helium here.  

In the future, I may also add other applications that aren’t available in the default Scoop buckets.  

## Installation

To install **Helium Browser** using this bucket:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add scoop-bucket https://github.com/fahim-ahmed05/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install scoop-bucket/helium
