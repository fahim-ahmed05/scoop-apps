# Scoop Bucket

This is my personal [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) bucket. 

## How do I install these manifests?

After manifests have been committed and pushed, run the following:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add <bucketname> https://github.com/fahim-ahmed05/scoop-bucket
scoop install <bucketname>/<manifestname>
```

## How do I contribute new manifests?

To make a new manifest contribution, please read the [Contributing
Guide](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/.github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and [App Manifests](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/wiki/App-Manifests)
wiki page.
