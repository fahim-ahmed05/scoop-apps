# Scoop Bucket

This is my personal [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) bucket. Currently, it contains the [Helium Browser](https://helium.computer/).  

I've submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/pull/16177) to include Helium Browser in the official Scoop [Extras](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras) bucket. Until it becomes available there, I'll maintain and update Helium Browser's manifest here.  

In future, I may also add other applications that arenâ€™t available in the default Scoop buckets.  

## Installation

To install **Helium Browser** using this bucket:

```powershell
scoop bucket add scoop-bucket https://github.com/fahim-ahmed05/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install scoop-bucket/helium
```

## Contribution

If you want to contribute a **new manifest**, please read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/.github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [App Manifests](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/wiki/App-Manifests) wiki page.
